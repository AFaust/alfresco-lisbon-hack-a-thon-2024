## Project Ideas

Participants are encouraged to work on projects that leverage Alfresco technologies.

**For people with a project idea**

For each project, you should consider addressing the following:

* The idea owner(s)
* A brief description
* Any prep work for the project, such as developer tools or skills participants should understand

We encourage you to keep your project idea short and provide any additional details in separate document or blog post within the Collaborate space. This may also allow you to coordinate with potential team members via the comments there without being mixed in with any discussions on this page.

**For people looking to join a project**

Please feel free to add your name to any project(s) you are interested in participating. Don't hesitate to add your name to multiple projects if you are considering multiple at this point. We encourage you to use this platform to contact the owner of an idea to discuss any details you are unsure about or even improve upon the idea.

Apart from any plans you make with the owner of an idea, you are not bound to actually participate in the project you indicated here. When you join the hack-a-thon on the day of the event you can check with other project teams and join a different project, if that turns out to be a better fit for you.

**For people looking for an idea**

If you're searching for ideas to kickstart your project, you've come to the right place. Below, you'll find inspiration drawn from past Hack-a-thon events, an overview of the latest features from Alfresco 7.x, and some exciting possibilities with Alfresco GenAI projects.

**For everyone**

The Hack-a-thon is as much a social event as it is a coding one. This means a lot of the attendees for this event often use it to exchange ideas and discuss other matters in the general Alfresco context.

After the event has come to an end, we encourage everyone that worked on a specific project idea to update the listing on this page with an overview of the project team and a link / reference to the results of the project (e.g. a GitHub repository, document or blog post in this space).

>> Feel free to come up with your own ideas and be creative!

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Code and Document**: Develop your project and ensure your code is well-documented.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit the output of your project via a pull request to this repository.
4. **Presentation**: Prepare a short presentation (5-10 minutes) to showcase your project that will happen in October Alfresco Tech Talk Live.

## Judging Criteria

Projects will be judged based on the following criteria:

- **Innovation**: How creative and original is the project?
- **Technical Difficulty**: How complex and technically challenging is the project?
- **Usability**: How user-friendly and practical is the solution?
- **Presentation**: How well is the project presented?

## Prizes

Prizes will be awarded to the top teams. Details about the prizes will be announced during the event.

# Projects

## Community Platform

**Provide an OpenSearch search subsystem for Alfresco Community**

Idea owner: @aborroy

Description: The aim of this project is to provide an OpenSearch search subsystem for Alfresco Community.

The main objective is to develop a new application that utilizes the existing [Repository SOLR endpoints](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/tree/master/remote-api/src/main/resources/alfresco/templates/webscripts/org/alfresco/repository/solr) to fetch information from the Repository and update the OpenSearch index using a polling process similar to the one currently employed in the Solr search subsystem.

Components to be developed:

- OpenSearch Search Subsystem as extension for [alfresco-community-repo](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/tree/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/subsystems/Search)
  - Support for AFTS and CMIS search syntax

- An application that can be run as a *container* (a basic implementation available in [alfresco-neural-search](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-opensearch-neural-search/tree/main/alfresco-neural-search))
  - Indexing
    - Metadata ingestion
    - Content ingestion
    - Permissions (potentially added to each OpenSearch document to reduce complexity)
    - Paths (including cascade updating of Path properties)
  - Configuration
    - Model synchronizer

>> The implementation should be compatible with an out-of-the-box OpenSearch service, including basic authentication with TLS or mTLS communication modes.
